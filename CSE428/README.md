# **Previous class recordings**

[Previous class recordings](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn12JjJn-4YnoOsrIuREbn3BmshSI3lHS&feature=shared)

My suggestion would be that you can watch the playlist video to get an initial idea of the topics. To understand in depth I would suggest you guys to watch videos on YouTube regarding the topic that you are studying.

Another Suggestion would be that, If possible do attend RRH sir’s class. Just take his permission that sir i want to attend you classes as well. Sir won’t reject.

Last Suggestion would be that, if possible, try to build a model by yourself for the project as it might come in handy for our project code.  Otherwise, You can use already defined models like YoloV8, V7, etc.

***'Notes credit goes to one of my friends [Ahmed Shakib Reza](https://github.com/shakib003/).  I studied his notes and watched the YouTube playlist [Previous Class Recordings] and it was more than enough for me.`***

I would suggest to go his gthub repository to get an idea.
